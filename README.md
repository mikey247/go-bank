# Go-bank is a project from Tech School's Backend masterclass course, it's a banking API built with GO, Postgres and SQLC.

## I'm taking this course because, it teaches backend engineering with Golang in detail from start to finish, including the Devops side of things with topics/teachings on AWS, Kubernetes, Github Actions etc.
